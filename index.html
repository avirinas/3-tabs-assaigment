        <p><span>Exercise benefits every part of the body, including the mind.</span> Exercise improves brain health and learning. It can help
        people sleep better. When you exercise, your body makes chemicals that help you feel good. Exercise lowers your chances
        of depression and decreases feelings of anxiety. Plus, exercise can give you a real sense of accomplishment and pride at
        having achieved a goal — like mastering a new dance routine or beating an old time in the 100-meter dash.</p>

        <p><span>Exercise helps people keep a healthy weight and lower their risk of some diseases.</span> Exercising regularly can help prevent
        weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Bone-strengthening exercise — like jumping,
        running, or lifting weights — can help keep bones strong</p>

        <p><span>Exercise can help a person age well.</span> This may not seem important now, but your body will thank you later. Regular
        exercise improves quality of life — the ability to enjoy things — as you get older. It can improve brain health and
        reduce the chance of getting Alzheimer’s. Exercising can help prevent falls
        and injuries from falls.</p>
